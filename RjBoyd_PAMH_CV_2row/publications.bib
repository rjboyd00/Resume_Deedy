	abstract = {Structural discovery of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) protein complexes is likely to become increasingly relevant with the development of new therapeutics targeting small GTPases and development of new classes of small molecules that inhibit protein-­protein interactions. Syx (also known as PLEKHG5 in humans) is a RhoA GEF implicated in the pathology of glioblastoma (GBM). Here we investigated protein expression and purification of ten different human Syx constructs and performed biophysical characterizations and computational studies that provide insights into why expression of this protein was previously intractable. We show that human Syx can be expressed and isolated and Syx is folded as observed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and actively binds to RhoA as determined by co-­elution during size exclusion chromatography (SEC). This characterization may provide critical insights into the expression and purification of other recalcitrant members of the large class of oncogenic—­Diffuse B-­ cell lymphoma (Dbl) homology GEF proteins. In addition, we performed detailed homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations on the surface of a physiologically realistic membrane. These simulations reveal novel insights into GEF activity and allosteric modulation by the plekstrin homology (PH) domain. These newly revealed interactions between the GEF PH domain and the membrane embedded region of RhoA support previously unexplained experimental findings regarding the allosteric effects of the PH domain from numerous activity studies of Dbl homology GEF proteins. This work establishes new hypotheses for structural interactivity and allosteric signal modulation in Dbl homology RhoGEFs.},

          , 
            Vaccines derived from chimpanzee adenovirus Y25 (ChAdOx1), human adenovirus type 26 (HAdV-D26), and human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-C5) are critical in combatting the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. As part of the largest vaccination campaign in history, ultrarare side effects not seen in phase 3 trials, including thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a rare condition resembling heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), have been observed. This study demonstrates that all three adenoviruses deployed as vaccination vectors versus SARS-CoV-2 bind to platelet factor 4 (PF4), a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of HIT. We have determined the structure of the ChAdOx1 viral vector and used it in state-of-the-art computational simulations to demonstrate an electrostatic interaction mechanism with PF4, which was confirmed experimentally by surface plasmon resonance. These data confirm that PF4 is capable of forming stable complexes with clinically relevant adenoviruses, an important step in unraveling the mechanisms underlying TTS.},
